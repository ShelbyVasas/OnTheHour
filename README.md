# Overview

This project uses React Native technologies to display a mobile application on the React Expo application.

Using the 'npx expo start' command, a QR code is presented in the terminal allowing the user to open the application in the downloadable Expo app. The user is taken to the home screen where they can then interact with the different features of the application.

I have been wanting to get into mobile app development and have had an idea for awhile about an application that will send the user a small scripture every hour they opt for so that they can begin to nourish their spirits regularly and create beginning habits of scripture study.
